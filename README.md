Advanced Web Page Development

This repository contains a zip file to all the contents included in my website.

This website was used as a starting landing page to advertise for the Streamliner Lounge which is a business associated with
a franchise of Ruby's Diner Restaraunts. 

The index file is the main starting point.

This project demonstrated proficiency in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and XML.

I earned an A on my project for utilizing multiple styling techniques, ineractive elements, and well written HTML.
